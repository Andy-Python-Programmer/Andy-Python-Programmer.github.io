difference between Mutex and a RwLock is that RwLock&lt;T&gt; requires more bounds for T to\nbe thread safe; Mutex requires T: Send to be Sync while on the other hand RwLock requires\nT: Send + Sync to be Sync. \nTo begin with, Mutex is a method of locking, to control access to shared resources. At the same time, only one thread\ncan access data that is protected inside the mutex. If another thread wants to lock a resource and the mutex\nis in locked state, the thread hangs until the locked thread releases the mutex; threads using mutex lack read concurrency.\nNext, RwLock is more complex then a Mutex hence, the performence is poor then a mutex. When there are more read \noperations and fewer write operations, read-write locks are efficient and can be used to improve thread read concurrency.\nAfter summing up all of the facts, use Mutex when there are more write operations and a RwLock when there are more\nread operations.\nResources\n\nMutex\nRwLock\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/mutex-vs-rwlock/","title":""},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/projects/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/projects/","title":"My Blog"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/mutex-vs-rwlock/":{"body":99,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/projects/":{"body":0,"title":1}},"length":4},"lang":"English"};
